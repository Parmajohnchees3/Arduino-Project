# Arduino-Project
BOE-BOT Arduino program to give BOT instructions to perform several tasks
This file was coded in C/C++ in order to implement into an Arduino. By the end of this challenge, the BOT could sense lines, sense color, communicate to other BOTS using XBee, and sense conductivity using metal whisker wires. It used Servos to move and an LCD Display to show the color and the location of where the BOT was depending on the color sensed.
